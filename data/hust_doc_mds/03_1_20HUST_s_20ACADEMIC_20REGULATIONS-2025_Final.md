## ACADEMIC REGULATIONS

(Issued together with Decision No. 5445/QĐ-ĐHBK, dated 28/05/2025 by the President of Hanoi University of Science and Technology)

## CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

## Article 1. Scope and Applicability

1. These regulations govern the training activities for full-time and part-time/in-service programs that confer bachelor's, engineer's, master's, or doctoral degrees from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). All other matters which are not addressed in these Regulations will be governed by the training regulations issued by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).
2. These regulations apply to undergraduate students, master's and engineer program students, and doctoral candidates of HUST (hereinafter collectively referred to as learners).
3. Level 2 units under or affiliated with HUST, which are assigned training responsibilities, are referred to collectively as schools/faculties/institutes

## Article 2. Fields of study and academic programs

1. A field of study (hereinafter referred to as "field") is a broad area of specialization, identified by a code in the Statistical List of Higher Education Fields of Study managed by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).
2. An academic program is developed based on a credit system and serves as the blueprint for the entire training process of a field. The program clearly specifies its educational level; the target students, admission requirements, and graduation requirements; the educational objectives, standards of knowledge, skills, and the level of autonomy and responsibility of learners upon graduation; the content (curriculum); the study plan based on a standard duration of study; the training methods and formats; the methods for assessing learning outcomes; and the conditions for program implementation.
3. An integrated academic program is a program designed holistically to integrate the knowledge and skills of two educational levels, ensuring continuous learning between the levels to optimize training time for learners. The integrated bachelor's-engineer's and bachelor's-master's programs are 5.5 years in duration with a total of 180 credits. The integrated program includes two levels: bachelor's degree (4 years of study, undergraduate level, awarded a bachelor's degree), and an Engineer degree at level 7 (1.5 years of study, awarded an engineer's degree) or Master's (1.5 years of study, awarded

a master's degree). The integration is reflected in the design of course modules in the bachelor's program, which provide foundational knowledge closely related to the specialized orientations of the engineer or master's programs .

4. The ELITECH program (an abbreviation of Elite Technology Program) is a high-quality academic program, demonstrated by several key factors: admission quality, learning outcomes, the value of the graduation diploma, the program delivery method, facilities, as well as the content, teaching methods, and language of instruction. ELITECH is a highly internationalized program, with English as the primary language of instruction, or potentially other foreign languages that meet the program's objectives. The curriculum is developed by referencing equivalent programs from reputable international universities. The program offers favorable conditions for student exchange, credit transfer, and dual-degree opportunities with partner institutions.

5. The Talent Program, a part of the ELITECH program, is designed to identify and nurture students with exceptional abilities, creative thinking, and a capacity for in-depth research. Students are selected for the program based on outstanding academic achievements and research potential. The program ensures that learners are equipped with in-depth knowledge oriented towards research, along with independent and creative thinking skills, to meet the demands for high-quality human resources. Lessons are conducted in small class sizes, with highly qualified instructors and modern teaching methods, which provides optimal conditions for students to develop their potential.

Students in the Talent Programs are also encouraged to participate in scientific research, academic exchanges, and have their earned credits recognized by partner institutions.

6. The standard duration and study load for formal full-time academic programs, excluding supplementary knowledge courses, are specified as follows:

| Programs | Participants | Standard Duration | Minimum credits |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Bachelor's degree | High school leavers | 4 years | 132 |
| Engineer's Degree | Bachelor's degree holders (integrated program) | 1.5 years | 48 |
| Engineer's Degree | Bachelor's degree holders | 2 years | 60 |
| Master's Degree | Bachelor's degree holders | 2 years | 60 |
| Master's Degree | Bachelor's degree holders (integrated program) | 1,5 years | 48 |
| Doctoral Program | Master's degree holders | 3 years | 106 |
| Doctoral Program | Bachelor's degree holders | 4 years | 151 |

7. The study duration for part-time/in-service programs is at least 20% longer than that of the corresponding full-time programs

8. All programs conferring bachelor's, engineer's, master's, and doctoral degrees must be publicly announced prior to admissions, in compliance with the current regulations of the Ministry of

Education and Training (MOET) and Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)'s program standards.

9. Programs may be adjusted and applied to each admission cohort; students enrolled in a given year will follow the curriculum version published for that year. Any updates to the program for a specific cohort may only be applied if they do not affect the accumulated academic results or conduct scores of the learners.

## Article 3. Study duration and academic planning

1. HUST conducts its academic activities on an academic year and semester basis. An academic year consists of two main semesters and one summer semester. The summer semester is organized based on learners' needs and the availability of instructors from the university/faculty/institute in charge.
2. The schedule for course registration, class timetables, exam dates, and graduation review adheres to the Academic Calendar of HUST.
3. Based on the standard academic plan for each program, learners develop their own semesterby-semester study plans:
- a) Learners are allowed to graduate early if they meet all graduation requirements of the program or graduate later than the standard duration. However, delays in progress must not exceed five main semesters for bachelor's programs and two main semesters for engineer's and master's programs.
- b) For learners in articulation/transfer programs who have been granted credit exemptions, the program duration is determined in accordance with the standard program duration, reduced proportionally to the number of recognized and exempted credits. The delay in progress must not exceed three main semesters and must not exceed twice the designed duration of the program.
- c) For doctoral programs, the standard duration ranges from 3 to 4 years. Doctoral candidates are considered full-time if they register for 30 credits per academic year. A doctoral candidate may extend the time for dissertation completion up to two times, with each extension lasting at least 6 months, and the total extension period is not permitted to exceed 24 months.
- d) For learners in undergraduate programs who are classified as priority candidates under the university admission regulations in effect at the time of their enrollment, the study duration must not exceed twice the standard academic plan duration, or the designed duration in the case of transfer programs.

## Article 4. Credits and courses

1. A credit is a unit used to measure academic workload. One credit corresponds to approximately 50 hours of standard learning activities, including lecture attendance, guided study, self-study, research, experiential learning, and participation in assessments.

For classroom-based instruction, one credit requires at least 15 hours of lectures, or 30 hours of practical work, experiments, or discussions; 45 hours of internship; 45 hours of assignments, projects, or a thesis/capstone project. One week of full-time project work is equivalent to 1 credit; one week of full-time internship is equivalent to 0.5-0.6 credits.

2. A course is a component of the curriculum and is completed within a single semester. The typical credit load in each course ranges from 1 to 4 credits, except for certain courses such as internship, capstone project/thesis, master's thesis, and doctoral dissertation, which may carry a higher credit load.

3. Each course is assigned a unique course code and may be included in different academic programs.

4. The curriculum may consist of compulsory and elective course groups, as follows:

- a) Compulsory courses: Learners must complete all courses listed in the designated catalog.
- b) Module-specific elective courses: Learners select a specialization track and must complete all courses listed within that specific module.

c) General elective courses: Learners select specified number of courses from a given list to accumulate the required credits.

## 5. Equivalent and Substitute Courses

a) Two courses are considered equivalent when they share at least 70% of their academic content. If necessary, a learner may choose to take an equivalent course to fulfill a required course in the program, provided that the number of credits of the equivalent course is equal to or greater than the required course. This regulation also applies to cases in which learners wish to improve their cumulative GPA (CPA).

b) Learners are allowed to take a substitute course, as designated by the school/faculty, in place of a required course that is no longer offered in the curriculum.

## 6. Course Pre-requisites and Enrollment Conditions

The prerequisites and conditions to register for a course are specified in its detailed syllabus and may include one or more of the following:

a) Prerequisite course: If Course A is a prerequisite for Course B, learners must successfully complete Course A before enrolling in Course B.

b) Pre-study course: If Course A is a pre-study course for Course B, learners must have registered for and completed Course A (not necessarily passed) before enrolling in Course B.

c) Concurrent course: If Course A is a concurrent course with Course B, learners must take Course A either before or at the same time as Course B.

7. The detailed syllabus of a course clearly outlines the study workload, prerequisites for enrollment, course objectives and learning outcomes, the extent to which the course contributes to the program's overall learning outcomes, assessment methods, course content, mode and language of instruction, as well as required textbooks and reference materials.

## Article 5. Course grades

1. For courses worth 2 credits or more, the grade is composed of two components: formative assessment and summative assessment, in which the final evaluation accounts for 0.5 to 0.8 of the total weight (or 50% to 80% of the total grade), as specified in the course syllabus. Courses worth less than 2 credits may be assessed either by a combination of formative assessment and summative exam, or by only summative assessment (the final evaluation) only.
2. Formative assessment may include midterm exams, regular quizzes, a combination of midterm and regular tests, or other components such as experiments, projects, essays, and class participation. The specific assessment methods and weightings are clearly defined in the course syllabus. For in-class sessions, attendance records may be used to add or subtract points from the formative assessment score of the course as follows:
3. The method of assessment and the weighting of the summative assessment are clearly specified in the detailed course syllabus.
4. Online assessment methods may be used if they are comparable to in-person assessments in terms of honesty, fairness, and objectivity. Their use must also be stipulated in a separate written policy.
5. Both formative assessment and summative assessment are graded on a 10-point scale, with increments of 0.5 points. Specific grading rules are as follows:
- a) A score below 5 for bachelor's capstone projects/theses or engineer's capstone projects is considered a failing grade.
- b) A score below 3 for all other types of courses (other than those specified in point a, clause 5 of this Article) is also considered a failing grade.
- c) If a learner misses the scheduled final exam without a valid reason, the exam score will be 0.
6. The final course grade is calculated as the weighted average of the component scores, rounded to one decimal place, and converted to a letter grade based on the rules below. However, if any component score is a failing grade, the overall course grade is an F. For GPA calculation, letter grades are converted into a 4-point scale

| No. of absences | 0 | 1-2 | 3-4 | ≥ 5 |
|--------------------------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| Added points/Subtracted points | +1 | 0 | -1 | -2 |

| 10-point Scale Grade | 0,0÷3,9 | 4,0÷4,9 | 5,0÷ 5,4 | 5,5÷6,4 | 6,5÷6,9 | 7,0÷7,9 | 8,0÷8,4 | 8,5÷9,4 | 9,5÷10 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|

| Letter Grade Equivalent | F | D | D+ | C | C+ | B | B+ | A | A+ |
|---------------------------|-----|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|
| 4-point Scale Equivalent | 0 | 1 | 1,5 | 2,0 | 2,5 | 3,0 | 3,5 | 4,0 | 4,0 |

7. Passing grades for courses are specified as follows:
- a) For bachelor's and engineer's programs: a passing grade is D or higher, except for capstone courses (including the bachelor's thesis/capstone project and the engineering capstone project), which require a grade of C or higher.
- b) For master's and doctoral academic programs: a passing grade is C or higher.
8. Learners may re-register for a course in which they have already received a passing grade to improve their CPA. The highest grade obtained will be recognized as the official grade for the course.
9. Some special letter grades are used in the following cases and cannot be converted into numerical scores for GPA calculation:
- a) Grade I: Course grade is incomplete due to an approved exam deferral.
- b) Grade X: Course grade is incomplete due to missing assessment data.
- c) Grade R: Course is waived and credit is recognized.
- d) Grade P: Applied to pass/fail courses, not included in GPA calculation.
10. đ) Grade W: Course has been officially withdrawn within the allowed withdrawal period.

## Article 6. Exam postponement, exam exemption, grade reappraisal, and grade appeals

1. Learners are allowed to take the final exam once for each course they have registered for in the semester (even if their formative assessment score is a failing grade), and no exam retake is permitted.
2. Learners who miss the midterm exam due to illness, accident, or other valid reasons may be permitted by the instructor to take a make-up midterm exam or take other alternative assessments.
3. Learners who are unable to take the final exam for a course (already attended and paid tuition) due to illness, accident, or other valid reasons are allowed to postpone the exam. They must then take the final exam for that course within the next two main semesters to complete the grade. Otherwise, the course will be graded F.
4. Learners may request a grade reappraisal or appeal within 7 days from the date the course grade is updated in their academic accounts. Grade reappraisals or appeals do not apply to courses assessed through oral exams or by evaluation committees.

Article 7. Accumulated credits and cumulative grade point average

1. Accumulated credits refer to the total number of credits from all courses with passing grades since the beginning of the program, including courses that have been waived or recognized for credit.
2. The semester grade point average (GPA) is calculated as the weighted average of the 4-point scale numerical grades for all courses taken in the semester, using the course credits as weights. The GPA is rounded to two decimal places.
3. The cumulative grade point average (CPA) is calculated as the weighted average of the numerical grades (converted to a 4-point scale) for all courses taken since the beginning of the academic program, using the course credits as weights. The CPA is also rounded to two decimal places.

## Article 8. Transfer to another educational institution

1. Undergraduate students who wish to transfer to another educational institution must obtain approval from the President of HUST and the head of the receiving institution. Freshman students, senior students, and students under academic dismissal review are not eligible to transfer.
2. Master's students who, due to a change in residence or workplace necessitating a move to another province, are unable to continue their studies at HUST may transfer to another institution (that offers a master's program in the corresponding field) with the approval of the President of HUST and the head of the receiving institution. Students in their final semester or those on academic probation or higher are not eligible to transfer.
3. Doctoral candidates (PhD students) who have at least 12 months remaining in their study period at HUST (according to their official acceptance decision) may transfer to another institution (that offers a doctoral program in the corresponding field) if approved by the President of HUST and the head of the receiving institution.

## Article 9. Tuition fees

1. Learners are required to pay tuition fees in full and by the specified deadline.
2. Learners who fail to pay tuition fees in full within the period stipulated in Clause 1 of this Article will be suspended from course registration for the following semester.
3. Learners in bachelor's and engineer's programs who submit a request to withdraw from a course within the first 7 weeks of the semester, and are approved, will only be required to pay 50% of the tuition fee for that course. An exception applies if the withdrawal request is made in the first week of the second main semester: if approved, the learner will not be charged any tuition for the withdrawn course. This provision does not apply to courses taken in the summer semester.
4. Learners in bachelor's and engineer's programs, who submit a request to withdraw from the program, take a leave of absence, or transfer to another institution within the first 7 weeks of the semester, and the request is approved, will be required to pay 50% of the semester tuition fee. This provision does not apply to courses taken in the summer semester.

5. Tuition fees for condensed/abbreviated courses are calculated at 50% of the regular course fee.
6. Tuition fees for doctoral candidates (PhD students) are calculated annually. These fees cover doctoral-level courses, but not supplementary courses.

## CHAPTER II. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS

## Article 10. Academic registration

1. Academic registration is a mandatory process for students in every semester, except for newly admitted students, who are assigned class schedules based on the standard study plan. These students are not required to register but may themselves adjust certain classes. Students must follow the registration process according to the timeline outlined in the Academic Calendar. The academic registration process consists of three phases:

a) Course registration: Students select the courses they plan to take in the upcoming semester. They may register according to the standard study plan or their personalized study plan. This phase typically takes place in the first few weeks of the preceding semester. Based on the number of students registered, HUST determines how many classes are in need to open and then publishes the schedule.

b) Official class registration: Students select specific classes for the courses they registered for. For courses that include multiple components (lectures, exercises, practical classes, labs, etc.), students must register for all required components.

- c) Registration adjustment: Students can change classes, cancel classes, or add new classes, including courses which are not previously registered. Each main semester includes two adjustment periods which end before the semester begins. Additional registration for already opened classes is only allowed during the first week of the semester. There is no adjustment period for the summer semester.

2. Number of registered credits:

- a) Students who are not under academic probation as stipulated in Clause 1, Article 19 of these Regulations may register for a maximum of 24 credits and a minimum of 12 credits in a main semester. The minimum credit registration threshold does not apply to final-year students. Students may register for a maximum of 8 credits in the summer semester.
- b) Students who are under academic probation as stipulated in Clause 2, Article 19 of these Regulations are eligible to register for a limited credit load.
3. After the registration adjustment period, students may request to withdraw from a course, then the grade of that course is not calculated.
4. For in-class courses, a class is only opened if there is a minimum of 20 students register. Exceptions are handled as follows:

a) Consider opening classes for ELITECH majors or programs with a small number of students, in order to maximize support for students following the standard academic plan.

b) Consider opening classes for 5 to 19 registered students, based on student requests, with tuition fees adjusted according to the applicable multiplier as regulated.

c) Consider opening classes for a group of fewer than 5 students to retake a course in the form of a course project, specifically for those students who have already completed their capstone project/thesis.

5. For in-class courses, consideration to open a condensed class will be given based on students' requests, provided that all of the following conditions are met concurrently:

- a) The student has taken the course at least twice but has not yet passed;
- b) The student's progress score for the course was 2.0 or higher in the most recent attempt.

c) The students are at least in their third-year of study, as stipulated in Clause 5, Article 12 of these Regulations.

6. The in-class teaching duration for a condensed course should last at least 50% of the standard course duration, with the teaching content focusing on the core knowledge and skills of the course.

## Article 11. Recognition of grades and credit transfer

1. The grades that a learner has accumulated from a different educational level, a different academic program, or another educational institution are considered for recognition and transfer into credits for courses within the program.

2. The recognition and transfer of credits are considered based on a benchmark of learning outcomes, course content, study load, course assessment methods, and quality assurance conditions of the program implementation at the following levels:

a) Recognition and transfer on a course basis.

b) Recognition and transfer on a course-group basis.

3. Students are permitted to conduct their capstone project/thesis at a domestic institution (higher education institution, research institute, enterprise, etc.) or at an overseas educational institution under a signed exchange program, but they must defend their capstone project/thesis at HUST to be evaluated and graded. For students in part-time/in-service programs at partner units, the evaluation of the capstone project/thesis may be conducted at the partner unit or at HUST.

4. The maximum number of credits that can be recognized and transferred cannot exceed 50% of the total credits of the entire academic program.

5. Students who have been subject to a decision of dismissal must retake the entire program, with the exception of the National Defense and Security Education program which awards a certificate, if they retake the entrance examination and are admitted,.

## Article 12. Student feedback and evaluation on academic performance

1. At the end of each semester, students do surveys to provide feedback on quality assurance conditions, the effectiveness of learning, and their satisfaction with the classes.
2. A student's academic performance for a semester is evaluated based on the grades of the courses registered in the curriculum, excluding courses with an R grade, foreign languages, Physical Education, and National Defense and Security Education. The evaluation includes the following indicators:
- a) Total number of credits earned from passed courses in the semester.
- b) Total number of credits not earned due to failed courses in the semester.
- c) Semester grade point average (GPA).
3. A student's academic progress is evaluated based on the grades of completed courses from the beginning, excluding foreign language courses, Physical Education, and National Defense and Security Education, and is reflected in the following indicators:
- a) Accumulated credits.
- b) Total number of credits from courses that the student has attempted but not yet passed since the beginning of the program.
- c) Cumulative grade point average (CPA).
4. Academic results of the summer semester are evaluated in the next main semester.
5. Students are classified by academic year level based on accumulated credits as follows:
6. Students are classified by their academic performance in each semester based on their semester GPA, and their overall academic standing from the beginning of the program is based on their CPA as follows:
7. When needed, the semester GPA and the CPA at average level or higher may be converted to the 10-point scale according to the following rules:

| No of credits earned | < 32 | 32-63 | 4-95 | 6-127 | ≥ 128 |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Level | Freshman | Sophomore | Junior | Senior | Higher Senior |

| GPA or CPA | < 1,0 | 1,0-1,99 | 2,0-2,49 | 2,5-3,19 | 3,2-3,59 | 3,6-4,0 |
|----------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Classification | Very poor | Poor | Average | Good | Very good | Excellent |

| 4 point scale | 10 point scale | Conversion formular 10 point scale = 4 point scale × a+ b |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2,0 - 2,5 | 5,5 - 7,0 | a = 3,00; b = - 0,5 |
| 2,5 - 3,2 | 7,0 - 8,0 | a = 1,42; b = 3,45 |
| 3,2 - 3,6 | 8,0 - 9,0 | a = 2,50; b = 0.00 |
| 3,6-4,0 | 9,0 - 10 | a = 2,50; b = 0.00 |

## Article 13. Undergraduate thesis/Capstone project

Graduation modules include the Bachelor's capstone project and the Bachelor's graduation thesis.

1. Students will be assigned a topic if they meet the requirements of the module, including prestudy courses, prerequisites, corequisites, as specified in the module's detailed syllabus.
2. The capstone project/thesis results are evaluated as follows:
- a) The score of capstone project/thesis is computed based on different component scores, with a weight of 0.5 for the formative assessment and 0.5 for the summative assessment.
- b) The scores given by the supervisor, the reviewer, and the evaluation committee members may be marked to the increments of 0.5 points.
- c) The capstone project/thesis progress score is the average of the supervisor's score and the reviewer's score, rounded to one decimal place. If either the supervisor's or the reviewer's score is below 5, the student is not allowed to defend the capstone project/thesis. In such cases, the defense score from the evaluation committee will be recorded as 0.
- d) The final evaluation score of the capstone project/thesis is the defense score given by the evaluation committee, calculated as the average of the scores given by committee members, rounded to one decimal place. If any committee member gives a score below 5, the defense is considered failed, and the score will be capped at a maximum of 4.9.

## Article 14. Undergraduate graduation registration

1. HUST conducts graduation assessments three times per year-specifically at the end of each main semester and at the end of the summer semester. Students wishing to be considered for graduation must register according to the timeline specified in the Academic Calendar.
2. Students may take more courses than required in the curriculum, but when registering for graduation, they must select the courses to meet the required number of credits of the program or no more than 3 additional credits. Exceptions will be reviewed by the Graduation Committee and submitted to the HUST President for approval.
3. Students who meet all of the following requirements are eligible for graduation:
- a) Have completed all required courses stated in the curriculum of the program within the designated time, including Physical Education and National Defense and Security Education courses.
- b) Have met the foreign language proficiency requirements.
- c) Have achieved a CPA (based on courses registered for graduation) of 2.0 or higher.
- d) Are not under criminal investigation and are not currently under disciplinary suspension at the time of graduation review.

4. Students who meet the graduation requirements will be granted official graduation recognition and awarded a diploma by decision of the President of HUST within 3 months from the date they fulfill all graduation requirements and related obligations.
5. Students who have exceeded the maximum allowed study duration as stipulated in Clause 3, Article 3 of these Regulations, but have not yet graduated due to incompletion of National Defense and Security Education or Physical Education courses, are permitted 3 additional years at maximum to register and complete the missing courses and request graduation review.
6. Students who are not eligible for graduation may request a certificate acknowledging the courses they have completed in the program.

## Article 15. Cumulative GPA (CPA) and undergraduate graduation classification

1. The cumulative GPA (CPA) is the overall GPA computed based on the courses registered for graduation.
2. Graduation classification is determined based on the CPA, following the academic performance classification specified in Clause 6, Article 12. However, in the following cases, students with a CPA classified as "Good" or higher will have their graduation classification reduced by one level:
- a) The number of credits from repeated courses exceeds 5% of the total number of credits used in calculating the CPA. This regulation does not apply to credits from courses retaken for grade improvement.
